# cwerner.dev

This is my personal portfolio build using GatsbyJS

1. Running the site and developing

Clone the respository, and then you can navigate into it and run the development server

```shell
cd cwerner.dev
gatsby develop
```

From there, you can edit the files and the server will automatically refresh when you save

2. Building for production

Use `gatsby build` to build a production version of the code.  This will be put in the `public` folder.
